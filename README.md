# QuantumPHP-ext Webextension

This webextension (add-on) parses server logs from QuantumPHP and adds them to the developer tools console.

## What it does

This extension automatically includes QuamtumPHP.js into web pages so that logs sent from the server can be displayed in the web console, even in Firefox Quantum. It is meant to be used with QuantumPHP, which was built to be a drop in replacement for ChromePHP.
