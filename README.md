# QuantumPHP

**This add-on adds server logs to the developer tools console.


## What it does

This extension automatically includes QuamtumPHP.js into web pages so that logs sent from the server can be displayed in the web console, even in Firefox Quantum. It is meant to be used with QuantumPHP, which is a drop in replacement for ChromePHP.
